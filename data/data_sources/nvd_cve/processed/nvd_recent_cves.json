What am I trying to do:\n\nThis patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure\nhandling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as\ncompared to 5.10 LTS.\n\n    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space\n    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space\n\n## 2. What is the expected outcome and why\n\n- For copyin case:\n\nKernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or\ncopy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return\n-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler\nchecks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be\nrecovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code\nspecified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.\n\n- For instr case:\n\nIf a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery\nis possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills\nby reading from storage.\n\n\n## 3. What actually happens and why\n\n- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17\n\nCommit 4c132d1d844a (\"x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage\") introduced a new\nextable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the\nextable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from\nEX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS\nhandling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().\n\n- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI\n  and #MCE race\n\nWhen an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the\nCMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA\nsignature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when\nthe data is about to be consumed.\n\n### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]\n\nPrior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that\ndetected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a\nbroadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action\nOptional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because\nit's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that\nbad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE\ninterrupts and finally become an IERR.\n\nHence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub\nfrom SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to\n#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in\nuc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*\nsignature name.\n\n### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in\n    Intel platform [1]\n\nHaving decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,\nthe memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is\nexecuting asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference\nbetween a \"real\" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if\nan error is found in any read.\n\nThus:\n\n1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a\n   speculative read.\n\n2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read\n   request\n\n3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the\n   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.\n\nQuite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory\ncontroller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction\nreading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page\n(marking it as poison).\n\n\n## Why user process is killed for instr case\n\nCommit 046545a661af (\"mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported\n\"not\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()\n\nDuring the \"size_check\" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended\nattribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs\n\"ea_get: invalid extended attribute\" and calls print_hex_dump().\n\nHere, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds\nINT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:\n\n\tint size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));\n\nAlthough clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper\nlimit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads\n\"size\" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).\n\nThe \"size\" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called \"len\" in\nprint_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned\ntype), this is then stored inside a variable called\n\"int remaining\", which is then assigned to \"int linelen\" which\nis then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()\nthe for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is\n18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()\non each iteration:\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {\n\t\tlinelen = min(remaining, rowsize);\n\t\tremaining -= rowsize;\n\n\t\thex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,\n\t\t\t\t   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);\n\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nThe expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken\nsince len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to\nthe \"ptr+i\" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer\nto the end of the actual bounds of \"ptr\", eventually an out of\nbounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following\nfor loop:\n\n\tfor (j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n\t\t\tif (linebuflen < lx + 2)\n\t\t\t\tgoto overflow2;\n\t\t\tch = ptr[j];\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nTo fix this we should validate \"EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)\"\nbefore it is utilised.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV\n\nRLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU\nregisters in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and\nregister reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir\n\nMounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir\nentry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later\non, when the corrupted directory is removed).\n\next4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.'\nand '..' as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads\nthe '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()\nand then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir\nentry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the\nsame data block.\n\nIf the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the\nsanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data\nblock) and leaves \"struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de\" point exactly past the\nmemory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to\next4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer\nwhich results in out-of-bounds mem access.\n\nFix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir\nentries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony\ndir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).\n\nNote: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another\nstructure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is\nreally an OOB read.\n\nThis issue was found by syzkaller tool.\n\nCall Trace:\n[   38.594108] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.594649] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88802b41a004 by task syz-executor/5375\n[   38.595158]\n[   38.595288] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5375 Comm: syz-executor Not tainted 6.14.0-rc7 #1\n[   38.595298] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[   38.595304] Call Trace:\n[   38.595308]  <TASK>\n[   38.595311]  dump_stack_lvl+0xa7/0xd0\n[   38.595325]  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x3f0\n[   38.595339]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595349]  print_report+0xaa/0x250\n[   38.595359]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595368]  ? kasan_addr_to_slab+0x9/0x90\n[   38.595378]  kasan_report+0xab/0xe0\n[   38.595389]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595400]  __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595410]  ext4_empty_dir+0x465/0x990\n[   38.595421]  ? __pfx_ext4_empty_dir+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595432]  ext4_rmdir.part.0+0x29a/0xd10\n[   38.595441]  ? __dquot_initialize+0x2a7/0xbf0\n[   38.595455]  ? __pfx_ext4_rmdir.part.0+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595464]  ? __pfx___dquot_initialize+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595478]  ? down_write+0xdb/0x140\n[   38.595487]  ? __pfx_down_write+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595497]  ext4_rmdir+0xee/0x140\n[   38.595506]  vfs_rmdir+0x209/0x670\n[   38.595517]  ? lookup_one_qstr_excl+0x3b/0x190\n[   38.595529]  do_rmdir+0x363/0x3c0\n[   38.595537]  ? __pfx_do_rmdir+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595544]  ? strncpy_from_user+0x1ff/0x2e0\n[   38.595561]  __x64_sys_unlinkat+0xf0/0x130\n[   38.595570]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x180\n[   38.595583]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

The skb is finally freed by\none of the in-irq-context safe functions: dev_consume_skb_any() or\ndev_kfree_skb_any().

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()\n\nIf track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple\ntree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation\nis not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.\n\nA reproducer can trigger this usually at the first try:\n\n  https://gitlab.com/davidhildenbrand/scratchspace/-/raw/main/reproducers/pat_fork.c\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 26 PID: 11650 at arch/x86/mm/pat/memtype.c:983 get_pat_info+0xf6/0x110\n  Modules linked in: ...\n  CPU: 26 UID: 0 PID: 11650 Comm: repro3 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5+ #92\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-2.fc40 04/01/2014\n  RIP: 0010:get_pat_info+0xf6/0x110\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ...\n   untrack_pfn+0x52/0x110\n   unmap_single_vma+0xa6/0xe0\n   unmap_vmas+0x105/0x1f0\n   exit_mmap+0xf6/0x460\n   __mmput+0x4b/0x120\n   copy_process+0x1bf6/0x2aa0\n   kernel_clone+0xab/0x440\n   __do_sys_clone+0x66/0x90\n   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180\n\nLikely this case was missed in:\n\n  d155df53f310 (\"x86/mm/pat: clear VM_PAT if copy_p4d_range failed\")\n\n... and instead of undoing the reservation we simply cleared the VM_PAT flag.\n\nKeep the documentation of these functions in include/linux/pgtable.h,\none place is more than sufficient -- we should clean that up for the other\nfunctions like track_pfn_remap/untrack_pfn separately.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs\nfound by Haoran Zhang:\n\n1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:\n\nThis fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is\ncalled more than once and calls after the first call do not find any\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:\n\nvhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);\n...\n\nkfree(vs->vs_tpg);\nvs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found\nmatch=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the\npointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:\n\nkfree(vs->vs_tpg);\nvs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf a scsi request is then sent we do:\n\nvhost_scsi_handle_vq -> vhost_scsi_get_req -> vhost_vq_get_backend\n\nwhich sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.\n\n2. Tpg dir removal hang:\n\nThis patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer\ntpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount\ndropping to -1.\n\nThe problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already\nin the vs->vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so\ntarget_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their\nrefcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added\nin the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in\nprevious calls which are also in vs->vs_tpg.\n\nLater, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs->vs_tpg which will drop\ntheir refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg\nand will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.\n\n3. Tpg leak:\n\nThis fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be\nun-removable because the target name is overwritten when\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different\ntarget names.\n\nThe bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup\na vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls\nVHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we\nhaven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this\nhappens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite\nthe target name and the vs->vs_tpg array. Later when we do\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's\nname and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the\nvs->vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing\ntarget_undepend_item on the tpgs.\n\nBecause of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major\nuser, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the\nissues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called\nif it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the\ntpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint\nfirst.",

It led to issues\nlike TCP timers not being cleared properly on close. The second commit\nmoved to a model of just holding an extra netns reference for\nserver->ssocket using get_net(), and dropping it when the server is torn\ndown.\n\nBut there remain some gaps in the get_net()/put_net() balancing added by\nthese commits.

After that, server->ssocket is set to NULL\nin the error path of generic_ip_connect(), and the net count cannot be\nreleased in the final clean_demultiplex_info() function.\n\n2. Potential use-after-free\n\nThe current refcounting scheme can lead to a potential use-after-free issue\nin the following scenario:\n\n```\n cifs_do_mount\n   cifs_mount\n     cifs_mount_get_session\n       cifs_get_tcp_session\n         get_net()  /* First get net */\n           ip_connect\n             generic_ip_connect\n               get_net()\n               bind_socket\n\t         kernel_bind /* failed */\n               put_net()\n         /* after out_err_crypto_release label */\n         put_net()\n         /* after out_err label */\n         put_net()\n```\n\nIn the exception handling process where binding the socket fails, the\nget_net() and put_net() calls are unbalanced, which may cause the\nserver->net reference count to drop to zero and be prematurely released.\n\nTo address both issues, this patch ties the netns reference counti\n---truncated---",

Dentry of gang\ndirectory was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone.\nOne problem was that failure of open kept calling simple_rmdir()\nas cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug was\nin the success case - gang creation incremented link count on\nroot directory, but that was no longer undone when gang got\ndestroyed.\n\nFix consists of\n\t* reverting the commit in question\n\t* adding a counter to gang, protected by ->i_rwsem\nof gang directory inode.\n\t* having it set to 1 at creation time, dropped\nin both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and bumped\nin spufs_create_context(), provided that it's not 0.\n\t* using simple_recursive_removal() to take the gang\ndirectory out when counter reaches zero.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudp: Fix memory accounting leak.\n\nMatt Dowling reported a weird UDP memory usage issue.\n\nUnder normal operation, the UDP memory usage reported in /proc/net/sockstat\nremains close to zero.  However, it occasionally spiked to 524,288 pages\nand never dropped.  Moreover, the value doubled when the application was\nterminated.  Finally, it caused intermittent packet drops.\n\nWe can reproduce the issue with the script below [0]:\n\n  1. /proc/net/sockstat reports 0 pages\n\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 0\n\n  2. Run the script till the report reaches 524,288\n\n    # python3 test.py & sleep 5\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 3 mem 524288  <-- (INT_MAX + 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT\n\n  3. Kill the socket and confirm the number never drops\n\n    # pkill python3 && sleep 5\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 524288\n\n  4. (necessary since v6.0) Trigger proto_memory_pcpu_drain()\n\n    # python3 test.py & sleep 1 && pkill python3\n\n  5. The number doubles\n\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 1048577\n\nThe application set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUF, which triggered an integer\noverflow in udp_rmem_release().\n\nWhen a socket is close()d, udp_destruct_common() purges its receive\nqueue and sums up skb->truesize in the queue.  This total is calculated\nand stored in a local unsigned integer variable.\n\nThe total size is then passed to udp_rmem_release() to adjust memory\naccounting.  However, because the function takes a signed integer\nargument, the total size can wrap around, causing an overflow.\n\nThen, the released amount is calculated as follows:\n\n  1) Add size to sk->sk_forward_alloc.\n  2) Round down sk->sk_forward_alloc to the nearest lower multiple of\n      PAGE_SIZE and assign it to amount.\n  3) Subtract amount from sk->sk_forward_alloc.\n  4) Pass amount >> PAGE_SHIFT to __sk_mem_reduce_allocated().\n\nWhen the issue occurred, the total in udp_destruct_common() was 2147484480\n(INT_MAX + 833), which was cast to -2147482816 in udp_rmem_release().\n\nAt 1) sk->sk_forward_alloc is changed from 3264 to -2147479552, and\n2) sets -2147479552 to amount.  3) reverts the wraparound, so we don't\nsee a warning in inet_sock_destruct().  However, udp_memory_allocated\nends up doubling at 4).\n\nSince commit 3cd3399dd7a8 (\"net: implement per-cpu reserves for\nmemory_allocated\"), memory usage no longer doubles immediately after\na socket is close()d because __sk_mem_reduce_allocated() caches the\namount in udp_memory_per_cpu_fw_alloc.  However, the next time a UDP\nsocket receives a packet, the subtraction takes effect, causing UDP\nmemory usage to double.\n\nThis issue makes further memory allocation fail once the socket's\nsk->sk_rmem_alloc exceeds net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min, resulting in packet\ndrops.\n\nTo prevent this issue, let's use unsigned int for the calculation and\ncall sk_forward_alloc_add() only once for the small delta.\n\nNote that first_packet_length() also potentially has the same problem.\n\n[0]:\nfrom socket import *\n\nSO_RCVBUFFORCE = 33\nINT_MAX = (2 ** 31) - 1\n\ns = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\ns.bind(('', 0))\ns.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUFFORCE, INT_MAX)\n\nc = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\nc.connect(s.getsockname())\n\ndata = b'a' * 100\n\nwhile True:\n    c.send(data)",

This issue can be reproduced if puting a\n'mdelay(10)' after 'mutex_unlock(&trace_types_lock)' in s_start(),\nand executing the following script:\n\n  $ echo function_graph > current_tracer\n  $ cat trace > /dev/null &\n  $ sleep 5  # Ensure the 'cat' reaches the 'mdelay(10)' point\n  $ echo timerlat > current_tracer\n\nThe root cause lies in the two calls to print_graph_function_flags\nwithin print_trace_line during each s_show():\n\n  * One through 'iter->trace->print_line()';\n  * Another through 'event->funcs->trace()', which is hidden in\n    print_trace_fmt() before print_trace_line returns.\n\nTracer switching only updates the former, while the latter continues\nto use the print_line function of the old tracer, which in the script\nabove is print_graph_function_flags.\n\nMoreover, when switching from the 'function_graph' tracer to the\n'timerlat' tracer, s_start only calls graph_trace_close of the\n'function_graph' tracer to free 'iter->private', but does not set\nit to NULL. This provides an opportunity for 'event->funcs->trace()'\nto use an invalid 'iter->private'.\n\nTo fix this issue, set 'iter->private' to NULL immediately after\nfreeing it in graph_trace_close(), ensuring that an invalid pointer\nis not passed to other tracers.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: fix crypto_free_acomp() deadlock in zswap_cpu_comp_dead()\n\nCurrently, zswap_cpu_comp_dead() calls crypto_free_acomp() while holding\nthe per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.  crypto_free_acomp() then holds scomp_lock\n(through crypto_exit_scomp_ops_async()).\n\nOn the other hand, crypto_alloc_acomp_node() holds the scomp_lock (through\ncrypto_scomp_init_tfm()), and then allocates memory.  If the allocation\nresults in reclaim, we may attempt to hold the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.\n\nThe above dependencies can cause an ABBA deadlock.  For example in the\nfollowing scenario:\n\n(1) Task A running on CPU #1:\n    crypto_alloc_acomp_node()\n      Holds scomp_lock\n      Enters reclaim\n      Reads per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1)\n\n(2) Task A is descheduled\n\n(3) CPU #1 goes offline\n    zswap_cpu_comp_dead(CPU #1)\n      Holds per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1))\n      Calls crypto_free_acomp()\n      Waits for scomp_lock\n\n(4) Task A running on CPU #2:\n      Waits for per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1) // Read on CPU #1\n      DEADLOCK\n\nSince there is no requirement to call crypto_free_acomp() with the per-CPU\nacomp_ctx mutex held in zswap_cpu_comp_dead(), move it after the mutex is\nunlocked.  Also move the acomp_request_free() and kfree() calls for\nconsistency and to avoid any potential sublte locking dependencies in the\nfuture.\n\nWith this, only setting acomp_ctx fields to NULL occurs with the mutex\nheld.  This is similar to how zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() only initializes\nacomp_ctx fields with the mutex held, after performing all allocations\nbefore holding the mutex.\n\nOpportunistically, move the NULL check on acomp_ctx so that it takes place\nbefore the mutex dereference.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: xhci: Don't skip on Stopped - Length Invalid\n\nUp until commit d56b0b2ab142 (\"usb: xhci: ensure skipped isoc TDs are\nreturned when isoc ring is stopped\") in v6.11, the driver didn't skip\nmissed isochronous TDs when handling Stoppend and Stopped - Length\nInvalid events. Instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which\nwould cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the\nmissed TD which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.\n\nThis buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged\nsince the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first\nand foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but\nby the spec I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.\n\nAfter d56b0b2ab142, TDs are immediately skipped when handling those\nStopped events. This poses a potential problem in case of Stopped -\nLength Invalid, which occurs either on completed TDs (likely already\ngiven back) or Link and No-Op TRBs. Such event won't be recognized\nas matching any TD (unless it's the rare Link TRB inside a TD) and\nwill result in skipping all pending TDs, giving them back possibly\nbefore they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe UAF by HW.\n\nAs a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this\nkind of event. Then the next event will skip missed TDs. A downside\nof not handling Stopped - Length Invalid on a Link inside a TD is\nthat if the TD is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated\nto account for TRBs (silently) completed before the TD was stopped.\n\nI had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there\nis no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. It may be\na very rare, obscure condition. The sole motivation for this patch\nis that if such unlikely event does occur, I'd rather risk reporting\na cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with UAF.\n\nThis will be fixed more properly by looking at Stopped event's TRB\npointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely\nto be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years.",

This vulnerability, categorized as a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.",

This can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. This vulnerability was previously reported in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable: /Videos/<itemId>/stream and /Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>, likely alongside similar endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. While the unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemId is required for exploitation and any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemId to make the exploit work.

This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication. This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement if combined with remote code execution.

In versions before 5.5.0, an attacker with access to the `/backup/import` API endpoint can write arbitrary files to locations outside the intended extraction directory due to a Zip Slip vulnerability. Although the application runs as a non-root user (`185`), limiting direct impact on system-level files, this vulnerability can still be exploited to overwrite application files (e.g., JAR libraries) owned by the application user. This overwrite can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application's context. This issue has been patched in version 5.5.0.",

    "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",

Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the \"invalid range\". This type of attack is called a \"DNS Rebinding Attack\". This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",

    "description": "mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions >= 2.4.16.11.",

Note\nthat the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to\nread it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.\n\nThis exact pattern happened in ucan.\n\nThe root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of\ndoing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as\nusb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable\ncan be removed.\n\nOn top of this do a couple refactors:\n\n  - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so\n    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to\n    char.\n\n  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware\n    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it\n    directly handle all the string termination logic.",

However, since the folio's index has not been updated\nto match the destination VMA, do_swap_page() will detect a mismatch.\n\nThis can result in two critical issues depending on the system\nconfiguration.\n\nIf KSM is disabled, both small and large folios can trigger a BUG\nduring the add_rmap operation due to:\n\n page_pgoff(folio, page) != linear_page_index(vma, address)\n\n[   13.336953] page: refcount:6 mapcount:1 mapping:00000000f43db19c index:0xffffaf150 pfn:0x4667c\n[   13.337520] head: order:2 mapcount:1 entire_mapcount:0 nr_pages_mapped:1 pincount:0\n[   13.337716] memcg:ffff00000405f000\n[   13.337849] anon flags: 0x3fffc0000020459(locked|uptodate|dirty|owner_priv_1|head|swapbacked|node=0|zone=0|lastcpupid=0xffff)\n[   13.338630] raw: 03fffc0000020459 ffff80008507b538 ffff80008507b538 ffff000006260361\n[   13.338831] raw: 0000000ffffaf150 0000000000004000 0000000600000000 ffff00000405f000\n[   13.339031] head: 03fffc0000020459 ffff80008507b538 ffff80008507b538 ffff000006260361\n[   13.339204] head: 0000000ffffaf150 0000000000004000 0000000600000000 ffff00000405f000\n[   13.339375] head: 03fffc0000000202 fffffdffc0199f01 ffffffff00000000 0000000000000001\n[   13.339546] head: 0000000000000004 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000\n[   13.339736] page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_pgoff(folio, page) != linear_page_index(vma, address))\n[   13.340190] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   13.340316] kernel BUG at mm/rmap.c:1380!\n[   13.340683] Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[   13.340969] Modules linked in:\n[   13.341257] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 107 Comm: a.out Not tainted 6.14.0-rc3-gcf42737e247a-dirty #299\n[   13.341470] Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n[   13.341671] pstate: 60000005 (nZCv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[   13.341815] pc : __page_check_anon_rmap+0xa0/0xb0\n[   13.341920] lr : __page_check_anon_rmap+0xa0/0xb0\n[   13.342018] sp : ffff80008752bb20\n[   13.342093] x29: ffff80008752bb20 x28: fffffdffc0199f00 x27: 0000000000000001\n[   13.342404] x26: 0000000000000000 x25: 0000000000000001 x24: 0000000000000001\n[   13.342575] x23: 0000ffffaf0d0000 x22: 0000ffffaf0d0000 x21: fffffdffc0199f00\n[   13.342731] x20: fffffdffc0199f00 x19: ffff000006210700 x18: 00000000ffffffff\n[   13.342881] x17: 6c203d2120296567 x16: 6170202c6f696c6f x15: 662866666f67705f\n[   13.343033] x14: 6567617028454741 x13: 2929737365726464 x12: ffff800083728ab0\n[   13.343183] x11: ffff800082996bf8 x10: 0000000000000fd7 x9 : ffff80008011bc40\n[   13.343351] x8 : 0000000000017fe8 x7 : 00000000fffff000 x6 : ffff8000829eebf8\n[   13.343498] x5 : c0000000fffff000 x4 : 0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000000000\n[   13.343645] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : ffff0000062db980 x0 : 000000000000005f\n[   13.343876] Call trace:\n[   13.344045]  __page_check_anon_rmap+0xa0/0xb0 (P)\n[   13.344234]  folio_add_anon_rmap_ptes+0x22c/0x320\n[   13.344333]  do_swap_page+0x1060/0x1400\n[   13.344417]  __handl\n---truncated---",

LAG state is already checked in\ncommit 15f8f168952f (\"net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding\nbond to bridge\"), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes\ninvalid state after initialization.\n\n Oops: stack segment: 0000 [#1] SMP\n CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 23695 Comm: kworker/u40:3 Tainted: G           OE      6.11.0_mlnx #1\n Tainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n Workqueue: mlx5_bridge_wq mlx5_esw_bridge_update_work [mlx5_core]\n RIP: 0010:br_switchdev_event+0x2c/0x110 [bridge]\n Code: 44 00 00 48 8b 02 48 f7 00 00 02 00 00 74 69 41 54 55 53 48 83 ec 08 48 8b a8 08 01 00 00 48 85 ed 74 4a 48 83 fe 02 48 89 d3 <4c> 8b 65 00 74 23 76 49 48 83 fe 05 74 7e 48 83 fe 06 75 2f 0f b7\n RSP: 0018:ffffc900092cfda0 EFLAGS: 00010297\n RAX: ffff888123bfe000 RBX: ffffc900092cfe08 RCX: 00000000ffffffff\n RDX: ffffc900092cfe08 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: ffffffffa0c585f0\n RBP: 6669746f6e690a30 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffff888123ae92c8\n R10: 0000000000000000 R11: fefefefefefefeff R12: ffff888123ae9c60\n R13: 0000000000000001 R14: ffffc900092cfe08 R15: 0000000000000000\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88852c980000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: 00007f15914c8734 CR3: 0000000002830005 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n PKRU: 55555554\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ? __die_body+0x1a/0x60\n  ? die+0x38/0x60\n  ? do_trap+0x10b/0x120\n  ? do_error_trap+0x64/0xa0\n  ? exc_stack_segment+0x33/0x50\n  ? asm_exc_stack_segment+0x22/0x30\n  ? br_switchdev_event+0x2c/0x110 [bridge]\n  ? sched_balance_newidle.isra.149+0x248/0x390\n  notifier_call_chain+0x4b/0xa0\n  atomic_notifier_call_chain+0x16/0x20\n  mlx5_esw_bridge_update+0xec/0x170 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5_esw_bridge_update_work+0x19/0x40 [mlx5_core]\n  process_scheduled_works+0x81/0x390\n  worker_thread+0x106/0x250\n  ? bh_worker+0x110/0x110\n  kthread+0xb7/0xe0\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n  </TASK>",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlock\n\nThere are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled\nasynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits\nsynchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during\nthe PM shutdown() callback.\n\nIf the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the\ndevice using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the\ndevice_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock\nhas already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while\nwaiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller\nwhich waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to\ndeadlock.\n\nThis is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died\nbefore shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()\ncallback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.\n\nAnd this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during\nthe PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the\ndevice_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if the\nrecovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is also\nobserved on the X1E80100 CRD.\n\nSo to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This\nfunction first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before\ntrying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it\nand reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,\nrecovery_work will fail with the error message \"Recovery failed\" as not\nmuch could be done.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvlan: enforce underlying device type\n\nCurrently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.\n\nBesides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a\nbug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.\n\nWhen creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)\nand MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.\n\nAs part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of\neach applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.\n\n__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new\nmulticast address.\n\nThis causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,\nsince the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6\nbytes long.\n\nThis behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:\n\nip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo\nip l set up dev gretest\nip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100\n\nThen, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:\n\nip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21\n\nFix the bug by enforcing the type of the underlying device during VLAN\ndevice initialization.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list\n\nchild_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq.\nThis 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list,\nmaking the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory\ncorruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and\nthe task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory\nfault or access garbage data.\n\nThe issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both\ncfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same\nleaf list. Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.\n\nThis adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main\nconditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of\noperation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.\n\nThis check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added\nto the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list\nhead is enough.\n\nFixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct\nlayout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable\nbehavior when the layout changes.",

I n VyOS, this is not the default configuration for the system SSH daemon, but is for the console service. To mitigate this, one can run \"rm -f /etc/dropbear/*key*\" and/or \"rm -f /etc/dropbear-initramfs/*key*\" and then dropbearkey -t rsa -s 4096 -f /etc/dropbear_rsa_host_key and reload the service or reboot the system before using Dropbear as the SSH daemon (this clears out all keys mistakenly built into the release image) or update to the latest version of VyOS 1.4 or 1.5.

This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level\ntriggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing\never sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not\nknow about their trigger type.\n\nEnsure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.",

The subsystem allows multiple\nuser space listeners to the region, while data of the payload was likely\nreleased before the listeners execute read(2) to access to it for copying\nto user space.\n\nThe issue was fixed by a commit 281e20323ab7 (\"firewire: core: fix\nuse-after-free regression in FCP handler\"). The object of payload is\nduplicated in kernel space for each listener. When the listener executes\nioctl(2) with FW_CDEV_IOC_SEND_RESPONSE request, the object is going to\nbe released.\n\nHowever, it causes memory leak since the commit relies on call of\nrelease_request() in drivers/firewire/core-cdev.c. Against the\nexpectation, the function is never called due to the design of\nrelease_client_resource(). The function delegates release task\nto caller when called with non-NULL fourth argument. The implementation\nof ioctl_send_response() is the case. It should release the object\nexplicitly.\n\nThis commit fixes the bug.",

When freeing zswap\nentries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries\nthat were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become\ninconsistent.\n\nThis inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:\n  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap\n  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng\n  $ sudo reboot\n\n  The two warnings are:\n    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():\n      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));\n\n    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():\n      if (WARN_ONCE(new < 0, \"page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\\n\",\n\t  new, nr_pages))\n\nzswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.\n\nAs suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap\nentries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,\nzswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries\nwhen it failed to zswap the entire folio.\n\nWhile this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and\nincrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and\nleave the optimization for later after some evaluation.\n\nAfter resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.\n\n[42.hyeyoo@gmail.com: refactor zswap_store_page()]",

And then calling:\n\n  $ iw dev mesh0 mesh leave\n  $ iw dev mesh0 mesh join my-mesh\n\nNote that typically these commands are not used / working when using\nwpa_supplicant. And it seems that wpa_supplicant or wpa_cli are going\nthrough a NETDEV_DOWN/NETDEV_UP cycle between a mesh leave and mesh join\nwhere the NETDEV_UP resets the mesh.ie to NULL via a memcpy of\ndefault_mesh_setup in cfg80211_netdev_notifier_call, which then avoids\nthe memory corruption, too.\n\nThe issue was first observed in an application which was not using\nwpa_supplicant but \"Senf\" instead, which implements its own calls to\nnl80211.\n\nFixing the issue by removing the kfree()'ing of the mesh IE in the mesh\njoin function and leaving it solely up to the mesh leave to free the\nmesh IE.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/secretmem: fix panic when growing a memfd_secret\n\nWhen one tries to grow an existing memfd_secret with ftruncate, one gets\na panic [1].  For example, doing the following reliably induces the\npanic:\n\n    fd = memfd_secret();\n\n    ftruncate(fd, 10);\n    ptr = mmap(NULL, 10, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);\n    strcpy(ptr, \"123456789\");\n\n    munmap(ptr, 10);\n    ftruncate(fd, 20);\n\nThe basic reason for this is, when we grow with ftruncate, we call down\ninto simple_setattr, and then truncate_inode_pages_range, and eventually\nwe try to zero part of the memory.  The normal truncation code does this\nvia the direct map (i.e., it calls page_address() and hands that to\nmemset()).\n\nFor memfd_secret though, we specifically don't map our pages via the\ndirect map (i.e.  we call set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() on every\nfault).  So the address returned by page_address() isn't useful, and\nwhen we try to memset() with it we panic.\n\nThis patch avoids the panic by implementing a custom setattr for\nmemfd_secret, which detects resizes specifically (setting the size for\nthe first time works just fine, since there are no existing pages to try\nto zero), and rejects them with EINVAL.\n\nOne could argue growing should be supported, but I think that will\nrequire a significantly more lengthy change.  So, I propose a minimal\nfix for the benefit of stable kernels, and then perhaps to extend\nmemfd_secret to support growing in a separate patch.\n\n[1]:\n\n  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffa0a889277028\n  #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page\n  PGD afa01067 P4D afa01067 PUD 83f909067 PMD 83f8bf067 PTE 800ffffef6d88060\n  Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC PTI\n  CPU: 0 PID: 281 Comm: repro Not tainted 5.17.0-dbg-DEV #1\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n  RIP: 0010:memset_erms+0x9/0x10\n  Code: c1 e9 03 40 0f b6 f6 48 b8 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 48 0f af c6 f3 48 ab 89 d1 f3 aa 4c 89 c8 c3 90 49 89 f9 40 88 f0 48 89 d1 <f3> aa 4c 89 c8 c3 90 49 89 fa 40 0f b6 ce 48 b8 01 01 01 01 01 01\n  RSP: 0018:ffffb932c09afbf0 EFLAGS: 00010246\n  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffda63c4249dc0 RCX: 0000000000000fd8\n  RDX: 0000000000000fd8 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffffa0a889277028\n  RBP: ffffb932c09afc00 R08: 0000000000001000 R09: ffffa0a889277028\n  R10: 0000000000020023 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffffda63c4249dc0\n  R13: ffffa0a890d70d98 R14: 0000000000000028 R15: 0000000000000fd8\n  FS:  00007f7294899580(0000) GS:ffffa0af9bc00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: ffffa0a889277028 CR3: 0000000107ef6006 CR4: 0000000000370ef0\n  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  Call Trace:\n   ? zero_user_segments+0x82/0x190\n   truncate_inode_partial_folio+0xd4/0x2a0\n   truncate_inode_pages_range+0x380/0x830\n   truncate_setsize+0x63/0x80\n   simple_setattr+0x37/0x60\n   notify_change+0x3d8/0x4d0\n   do_sys_ftruncate+0x162/0x1d0\n   __x64_sys_ftruncate+0x1c/0x20\n   do_syscall_64+0x44/0xa0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n  Modules linked in: xhci_pci xhci_hcd virtio_net net_failover failover virtio_blk virtio_balloon uhci_hcd ohci_pci ohci_hcd evdev ehci_pci ehci_hcd 9pnet_virtio 9p netfs 9pnet\n  CR2: ffffa0a889277028\n\n[lkp@intel.com: secretmem_iops can be static]\n[axelrasmussen@google.com: return EINVAL]",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug\n\nIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the\ncurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used\nthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,\nit is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.\n\nIf the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,\nwe run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx\nare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. \nacomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use\ncrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the\ncrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was\nretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the\nCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the\ncrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.\n\nUse the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating\nand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure\nthat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the\ncompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after\nacquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new\nCPU.\n\nThe initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug\ncallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is\nallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU\nhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by\ncompression/decompression.\n\nPreviously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This\nwould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already\nholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a\ndeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but\nJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug\nnotifiers [2].\n\nAlternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:\n- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in\n  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in\n  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the\n  CPU is onlined.\n- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but\n  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could\n  result in subtle performance issues.\n\n[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n\n[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]",

    "description": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade.

The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release.

Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well.

We are guaranteed\nto have at least one stable reference in slow path, so the simple atomic add\ncould be used.  The performance difference should be trivial, but the\nmisuse may be confusing and misleading.\n\nRedefined try_grab_folio() to try_grab_folio_fast(), and try_grab_page()\nto try_grab_folio(), and use them in the proper paths.  This solves both\nthe abuse and the kernel warning.\n\nThe proper naming makes their usecase more clear and should prevent from\nabusing in the future.\n\npeterx said:\n\n: The user will see the pin fails, for gpu-slow it further triggers the WARN\n: right below that failure (as in the original report):\n: \n:         folio = try_grab_folio(page, page_increm - 1,\n:                                 foll_flags);\n:         if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!folio)) { <------------------------ here\n:                 /*\n:                         * Release the 1st page ref if the\n:                         * folio is problematic, fail hard.\n:                         */\n:                 gup_put_folio(page_folio(page), 1,\n:                                 foll_flags);\n:                 ret = -EFAULT;\n:                 goto out;\n:         }\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1719478388-31917-1-git-send-email-yangge1116@126.com/\n\n[shy828301@gmail.com: fix implicit declaration of function try_grab_folio_fast]",

Prior to version 0.26.1, the Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users. This issue may be more severe in the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied through Pomerium, that script could access these tokens by making a request to the `/.pomerium` endpoint. Upstream applications that authenticate only the ID token may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner. Note that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user impersonation via these tokens provided the application verifies the Pomerium JWT for each request, the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS, or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the network layer. The issue is patched in Pomerium v0.26.1. No known workarounds are available.",

This issue has been addressed in version 2.12.10 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

    "description": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an untrusted note opened in safe mode to execute arbitrary code. `packages/renderer/MarkupToHtml.ts` renders note content in safe mode by surrounding it with <pre> and </pre>, without escaping any interior HTML tags. Thus, an attacker can create a note that closes the opening <pre> tag, then includes HTML that runs JavaScript. Because the rendered markdown iframe has the same origin as the toplevel document and is not sandboxed, any scripts running in the preview iframe can access the top variable and, thus, access the toplevel NodeJS `require` function. `require` can then be used to import modules like fs or child_process and run arbitrary commands. This issue has been addressed in version 2.12.9 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSquashfs: check the inode number is not the invalid value of zero\n\nSyskiller has produced an out of bounds access in fill_meta_index().\n\nThat out of bounds access is ultimately caused because the inode\nhas an inode number with the invalid value of zero, which was not checked.\n\nThe reason this causes the out of bounds access is due to following\nsequence of events:\n\n1. Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcache\n\nWhen skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threads\nswapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B). \nBefore one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to the\nPTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free the\nentry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. \nIt breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,\ncausing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into the\nPTE and cause data corruption.\n\nOne possible callstack is like this:\n\nCPU0                                 CPU1\n----                                 ----\ndo_swap_page()                       do_swap_page() with same entry\n<direct swapin path>                 <direct swapin path>\n<alloc page A>                       <alloc page B>\nswap_read_folio() <- read to page A  swap_read_folio() <- read to page B\n<slow on later locks or interrupt>   <finished swapin first>\n...                                  set_pte_at()\n                                     swap_free() <- entry is free\n                                     <write to page B, now page A stalled>\n                                     <swap out page B to same swap entry>\npte_same() <- Check pass, PTE seems\n              unchanged, but page A\n              is stalled!\nswap_free() <- page B content lost!\nset_pte_at() <- staled page A installed!\n\nAnd besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard the\nentry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()\non CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause data\nloss.\n\nTo fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry using\nthe cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent any\nparallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin after\nPT unlocked.\n\nRacers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  A\nschedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated page\nfaults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise to\nperf statistics.  A similar livelock issue was described in commit\n029c4628b2eb (\"mm: swap: get rid of livelock in swapin readahead\")\n\nReproducer:\n\nThis race issue can be triggered easily using a well constructed\nreproducer and patched brd (with a delay in read path) [1]:\n\nWith latest 6.8 mainline, race caused data loss can be observed easily:\n$ gcc -g -lpthread test-thread-swap-race.c && ./a.out\n  Polulating 32MB of memory region...\n  Keep swapping out...\n  Starting round 0...\n  Spawning 65536 workers...\n  32746 workers spawned, wait for done...\n  Round 0: Error on 0x5aa00, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!\n  Round 0: Error on 0x395200, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!\n  Round 0: Error on 0x3fd000, expected 32746, got 32737, 9 data loss!\n  Round 0 Failed, 15 data loss!\n\nThis reproducer spawns multiple threads sharing the same memory region\nusing a small swap device.  Every two threads updates mapped pages one by\none in opposite direction trying to create a race, with one dedicated\nthread keep swapping out the data out using madvise.\n\nThe reproducer created a reproduce rate of about once every 5 minutes, so\nthe race should be totally possible in production.\n\nAfter this patch, I ran the reproducer for over a few hundred rounds and\nno data loss observed.\n\nPerformance overhead is minimal, microbenchmark swapin 10G from 32G\nzram:\n\nBefore:     10934698 us\nAfter:      11157121 us\nCached:     13155355 us (Dropping SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO flag)\n\n[kasong@tencent.com: v4]",

In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files, resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to parse XML files that have XML external entities.",

    "description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In affected versions when unpacking Tar archives, Gradle did not check that files could be written outside of the unpack location. This could lead to important files being overwritten anywhere the Gradle process has write permissions. For a build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this issue could allow Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an arbitrary file read. To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to either control the source of an archive already used by the build or modify the build to interact with a malicious archive. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Starting from these versions, Gradle will refuse to handle Tar archives which contain path traversal elements in a Tar entry name. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is a path traversal vulnerability when Gradle deals with Tar archives, often referenced as TarSlip, a variant of ZipSlip.\n\n* When unpacking Tar archives, Gradle did not check that files could be written outside of the unpack location. This could lead to important files being overwritten anywhere the Gradle process has write permissions.\n* For a build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this issue could allow Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an arbitrary file read.\n\nTo exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to either control the source of an archive already used by the build or modify the build to interact with a malicious archive. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed.\n\nGradle uses Tar archives for its [Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html). These archives are safe when created by Gradle. But if an attacker had control of a remote build cache server, they could inject malicious build cache entries that leverage this vulnerability. This attack vector could also be exploited if a man-in-the-middle can be performed between the remote cache and the build.\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Starting from these versions, Gradle will refuse to handle Tar archives which contain path traversal elements in a Tar entry name.\n\nIt is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround.\n\n* If your build deals with Tar archives that you do not fully trust, you need to inspect them to confirm they do not attempt to leverage this vulnerability.\n* If you use the Gradle remote build cache, make sure only trusted parties have write access to it and that connections to the remote cache are properly secured.\n\n### References\n\n* [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n* [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)\n* [ZipSlip](https://security.snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)",

    "description": "There had existed in one of the ISC BIND libraries a bug in a function that was used by dhcpd when operating in DHCPv6 mode. There was also a bug in dhcpd relating to the use of this function per its documentation, but the bug in the library function prevented this from causing any harm. All releases of dhcpd from ISC contain copies of this, and other, BIND libraries in combinations that have been tested prior to release and are known to not present issues like this. Some third-party packagers of ISC software have modified the dhcpd source, BIND source, or version matchup in ways that create the crash potential. Based on reports available to ISC, the crash probability is large and no analysis has been done on how, or even if, the probability can be manipulated by an attacker. Affects: Builds of dhcpd versions prior to version 4.4.1 when using BIND versions 9.11.2 or later, or BIND versions with specific bug fixes backported to them. ISC does not have access to comprehensive version lists for all repackagings of dhcpd that are vulnerable. In particular, builds from other vendors may also be affected. Operators are advised to consult their vendor documentation.",
